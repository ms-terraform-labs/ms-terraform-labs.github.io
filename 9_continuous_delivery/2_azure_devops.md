# Azure DevOps Pipelines Continuous Delivery Lab

During this lab you will setup Azure and Azure DevOps using Terraform then run a Continuous Delivery pipeline to deploy infrastructure using Managed Identity (or OIDC if you are part of the preview) to authenticate to the State file and Azure.

You will also try out a Pull Request workflow.
